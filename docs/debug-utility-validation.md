## Summary

**Total Commands:** 13  
**Passed:** 13 ✅  
**Failed:** 0 ❌  
**Issues Found & Fixed:** 1 (logs table name)

### Key Achievements

1. **Archive Verification:** `archive-status` command solves the timing confusion that caused 276 vs 502 vs 725 discrepancies
2. **Health Monitoring:** `bot-status` and `railway-status` provide real-time deployment health
3. **Deployment Diagnostics:** `deployments` command successfully identified historical duplicate deployment issue
4. **Comprehensive Coverage:** All major debugging scenarios covered

### Recommendations

1. ✅ **Use `archive-status`** to verify archive is keeping up (shows created vs archived)
2. ✅ **Use `bot-status`** for quick health check before investigating issues
3. ✅ **Use `deployments`** daily to catch duplicate deployment issues early
4. ✅ **Use `db-stats`** for quick overview of database activity, including live-update runs/feed items
5. ✅ **Use `trace live-update`** for the active editorial loop; `trace summary` is legacy daily-summary/backfill tracing

### Commands to Run Daily

```bash
# Morning health check
python scripts/debug.py bot-status
python scripts/debug.py archive-status
python scripts/debug.py deployments
python scripts/debug.py trace live-update

# If issues detected
python scripts/debug.py railway-status
python scripts/debug.py logs --hours 6
```

## Conclusion

**All debug commands are working correctly and provide comprehensive coverage for investigating bot issues.** The archive-status command specifically addresses the confusion about message counts by providing consistent timestamp-based comparisons.
